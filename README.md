# Task-Trees
The new and improved version of EZTasks. Task Trees is a macOS app that helps you get tasks done. Tasks are broken up into 2 categories - "on the fly" tasks that are treated like trees (they can have child tasks that must be completed before they can be completed) and "everyday" tasks that repeat some fixed amount of days.
